# T3 Joomla Gulp Tasks

T3 Joomla Gulp Tasks is a collection of gulp tasks for use with the free T3 Joomla Framework blank T3 Template with Bootstrap 3.


## Gulp Tasks

  Watch Task
  ```sh
  gulp watch
  ```
 - Starts browserSync and watches the less, js and php files in the template. Upon changes it reloads browserSync.

>T3 Joomla Gulp Tasks is a work in progess. I created this because I wanted to use browserSync however with all of the nice features baked into the T3 Framework for some reason this is left out or at least I didn't find it. For now this is all I needed to get started with BrowserSync and the current T3 Framework and T3 Blank Bootstrap 3 Template. Requires enviroment running node >= 0.12.
